Box2DX is a C# port of Box2D - Erin Catto's 2D Physics Engine. You can find original C++ version on www.box2d.org

Collision:
  * Continuous collision detection.
  * Contact callbacks: add, persist, remove.
  * Convex polyons and circles.
  * Multiple shapes per body.
  * One-shot contact manifolds.
  * Incremental sweep-and-prune broadphase.
  * Efficient pair management.
  * Fast broadphase AABB queries.
  * Collision groups and categories.

Physics:
  * Continuous physics with time of impact island solver.
  * Persistent body-joint-contact graph.
  * Island solution and sleep management.
  * Contact, friction, and restitution.
  * Stable stacking with a linear-time solver.
  * Revolute, prismatic, distance, pulley, gear, and mouse joints.
  * Joint limits, motors, and friction.
  * Momentum decoupled position correction.
  * Fairly accurate reaction forces/impulses.


System:
  * Centralized tuning parameters.
  * Pure .NET 2.0 library.
